    <strong> Branding system, business cards, Social Media Manual and Instagram launch. A brand going into the saturated market of craft beer with a tropical spin. </strong> 
		Bebe Craft Puerto Rico, is a craft beer destributer in Puerto Rico that specializes in beers crafted in the south of the United States. 
		<br> 
		The Bebe Craft brand is colorful and coporate. Professional and playfull. The perfect mix. We drew inspirations from hand crafted human side behind craft beers together with the solidity and movement that distribution brings. Bebe Craft is opening beer up to Puerto Rico, it is cracking a cold one in the tropics.

    <strong> Branding system for a publishing house that sponsors and publishes young designers and artist. </strong> 
		While I was in studying abroad in Venice, taking classes with TankBoys, two local graphic designers distinguished worldwide, I created a branding system for a publishing company. This project was a complete start to end project where I was in charge of the type of company I wanted to create and how. I decided to create a publishing company that helped promising young designers and writers get published. With the help of my roommate at the time I decided to call it FreshPress. 

The logo shows the gears of  printing press, as if the paper was going through the gears within the “s.” The colors are modern and sleek, dark grey, to show professionalism while the name has a fun catchy name to draw in our clients. 
 
The next step, after the branding identity was created was to publish a book and create the promotional material for it. Visit Stop Eating Ramen project page to view the book I wrote, designed and published. It focuses on cheap and easy (and healthy) recipes targeting broke college students, like myself at that time.
