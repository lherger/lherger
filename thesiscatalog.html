    <strong> Thesis show catalog showcasing all the artist and the work of the 2018 CFA SVA graduating class. </strong> 
		Collected over 40 artist statements and photographs from Boston University’s College of Fine Arts graduating class. Planned, designed and sent to production for the thesis show  on May 5, 2018. The branding for the show was a commemoration to the gallery space, an old Chevy show room turned gallery that was being demolished to become a student center. The space was being taken away from artists by an institution that made them (us) believe it cared for art. The thesis show was the last of it’s kind. We also wanted to highlight the different artist graduating and how everyone put their personalities and personal stories in their work. Each artist, weather they were a painter, designer or sculptor, their work was specific to their beliefs and their persona.
